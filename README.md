## Advent of Code 2020

In 2020, I've chosen [Advent Of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020) to have some fun by coding.
This is an amazing opportunity to practice, learn something new, challenge yourself, and keep you humble!

Also, I've set some personal rules:
1. Every code should be written (mostly) in imperative (or algorithmic) style, sometimes in functional style or idiomatic Python;
2. Every code should be written in Python 3;
3. I could use only the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), no other Python library.

So, right now I've decided to share my experience in this repository. Enjoy!
